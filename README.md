Wednesday, May 31: Sorting
--------------------------

1. Write a function `void printArray(int *arr, int size)` that outputs all of the integers in the passed array.
2. Write a function `int * sort(int *arr, int size)` that returns a `new`-allocated copy of `arr` in sorted order (`{3, 1, 2} -> {1, 2, 3}`).
3. As the size `N` increases, how would you characterize the amount of time your `sort` function takes? That is, does it look like it's proportional to `N`, `N^2`, `N^3`, or something else? Determine this without measuring.
